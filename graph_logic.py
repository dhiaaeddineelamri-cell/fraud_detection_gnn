"""
Nexus AI - Graph Logic
The "brain" of the fraud detection system.

This module constructs a network graph from insurance claims data and uses
graph algorithms to detect fraud patterns (simulating GNN output for demo purposes).

Detection Strategy:
- Community Detection: Identifies tightly-knit groups (fraud rings)
- Degree Centrality: Finds highly connected nodes (fraud hubs)
- Risk Scoring: Combines metrics to assign suspicion levels
